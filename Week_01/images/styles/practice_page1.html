            I hope that this divides the paragraph in half .
            <hr> 
            This will actually be written as a straight line on the web broweser .
            Even though I am not doing this very well , it will still be written on a straight line dude
            <hr>
            Frankly this is all still inside the paragraph tag .<br> It should just change already .<br> I do like it though , it is pretty cool !
        </p>
        <b>This should make the text really bold</b>
        <p><strong>This should be really strong </strong></p>
        <pre>
            Now I will write out something with cool formatting                                   .Sorta like This
            And like this 
            And like that
                                                     Maybe even like this 
                                                     The whitespace will not be ignored 
            Make like an awesome shape and stuff.
