*The purpose of a web browser is to display a HTML file . The browser uses the HTML tags to display the content of an HTML file.
*It is crucial to know that tags always have content in between them . That is why there is an opening and a closing tag.
Remember that all the things that will appear in the browser are written within the <body> .
Most tags must have an opening and a closing tag . A closing tag looks like this </body>.
Nesting is when we have tags inside of tags . We have the parent tags and the children tags .
The basic structure of any HTML page always looks like this :
<!Doctype html>
<html lang = "en"> **You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
    <head>
    <title> Page Title </title>
    </head>
    <body>
    *This is where all the stuff that appear in the webpage will be shown. 
    </body>  

</html>

        **Notice that when working with links in HTML the destination of the link goes in the src attribute. Then the part you click on goes inside of the <a> element.
        #attribute names and tags are alwasy in lower case . It is good practice to keep it this way .
        <img src "voyager.jpg" alt = "docking station"> # The image tag does not need a closing tag , because there is no content in between the tags , all the info is inside the attribute. 
</header>

COMMON TAGS USED IN HTML
<a href = "link.com">Click here to open this link </a> *This is a link tag . It directs you to a specific link on the internet 
HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:
<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142"> * You can add width and height to your img tag. Those are additional attributes. Using this means you don't have to size the image differenlty before inserting it .
the alt = "" attribute specifies the name of the image . It may appear in the place of an image if the image does not appear for whatever reason .
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more. This can be either an attribute or a tag .
<style></style> or like this <p style = "">Whatever dude</p>
<p></p> *When writing text using the paragraph tag , the browser will automatically create its own whitespaces . So even if i try to create my own like this l        o        v       e      l      i . The browser will ignore this 
<hr> *THIS does not have a closing tag . This tag will seperate sentences inside a paragraph , and it will draw a horizontal line when used.
<br> This is like the /n in python . It will start a new line without havinf to open a new <p></p> tag .
<pre></pre> Using these elements , will not ignore your whitespaces or formatting . The browser will dispaly it exactly as you write it in HTML. BUT, IT COMES WIHT ITS OWN FONT , SO IT WILL LOOK DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THE TEXT .
The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.This attribute goes inside the <a>link</a> tag .
i.e <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a>
